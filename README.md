# CE3004_arduino
Arduino code for CE3004 MDP project


Welcome! This is my code for the arduino robot. You can email me at achan021@e.ntu.edu.sg if you have any queries. I will help with the best of my abilities. 


The code may contain some manual tuning due to time constraints of race day and some coding components can be further optimised to make the code cleaner. So, do take note if you are doing a wholesale copy.
